The patient is 69 year old female admitted with confusion concerning for new diagnosis of neurodegenerative condition, seen by neurology and MRI brain is pending. The patient wants to have a shower. She says she showers usually twice a day and cannot have a shower here which is why she wants to go home. She is vaguely aware that she may have Alzheimer's disease and knows that she is in some sort of care facility but cannot tell me that she is in the hospital. I told her that we are waiting for an MRI, and she is agreeable with this plan.

Continue to try to redirect her.  Can try to offer a sponge bath Quetiapine as needed      GIM Progress Note  13JAN2024 08:20       Hospital Progress  Patient was seen.  RN was briefly at bedside  She is wondering into her neighbors room, but again redirectable  Repeat LFTs have improved.  Ammonia level only 16 which does not necessarily always correlate anyway and I doubt this is hepatic encephalopathy based on behavior.  Vitamin B12 197.  Increasingly, clinical picture seems to point to cognitive impairment rather than delirium.  Geriatrics consultation pending, along with multidisciplinary team assessment.

Unfortunately, patient was insistent on leaving hospital.  Fortunately, she remains redirectable.  I suspect once again this is due to underlying dementia/cognitive decline rather than delirium.  MRI head currently pending.  Geriatrics consult also pending with respect to possible underlying dementia/BPSD.  Geriatrics suspects Alzheimer's dementia.  Wandering is a concern.  I see they have seen patient by the time of this dictation, I refer to the most detailed note for information and thankful for their input.  Likely outpatient followup geriatrics memory clinic.  Form 1 has expired.  Daughter clearly expressed concern patient is not able to return home due to not being able to care for herself.  Patient might require form 3.  Charge nurse has left message for psychiatry to reassess.  From geriatrics note, there are concerns of paranoia as well.  Although patient lives with family, they do work and therefore patient might be left alone and is not safe for discharge.  I have ordered a sitter and repeat psychiatry assessment to determine form 3 eligibility.  Patient was seen by Dr. FAKEDOCTOR last week.

[1] Selected Notes & Imaging Results  Current Issues, Assessment and Plan  Ordered:  Consult to Psychiatry OT Follow Up Sitter    GIM Progress Note  16JAN2024 20:13       Hospital Progress  Spoke with psychiatry: I fill out form 1 today.  Psychiatry will assess and most likely fill out form 3 most likely after discussion with Dr. FAKEDOCTOR.  No family at bedside.  However, daughter was updated today before.   Today, when I saw her she was directable, and said that she was enjoying her burger at bedside.  She says she did not get from hospital and someone caught it for her.    MRI has been done, see below.  Seen by geriatrics: Delirium seems resolving, patient closer to baseline.  Concern re Alzheimer's dementia, constipation.  Disposition remains a challenge and might require Twaddle Grace Hospital home monitoring program for falls detection and GPS tracking.  Psychiatry will be involved as well.  Currently has been placed on form 3.  Based on extensive workup, 1 suspect that she might be close to her baseline with respect to dementia.  Therefore, main barrier to discharge might potentially be a social one  when services could be in place will need to address home needs if children are working during the day and she might be at risk for wandering and is alone.

COMPARISON: Head CT January 11, 2024 and prior imaging.

[1] Current Issues, Assessment and Plan  [1] MRI Head Dementia; 01/16/2024 10:28 EST      GIM Progress Note  17JAN2024 16:57       Hospital Progress  I have updated patient's daughter over the telephone and questions answered.  Essentially, psychiatry has placed patient on form 3; sitter ordered; geriatrics noted that delirium is resolving.  We may well be witnessing patient's new baseline.  Therefore, discussed with family with respect to disposition.  Assuming patient is now in her new baseline, question is disposition and I encouraged daughter to speak with each other to discuss what options they could come up with and will liaise with social work.  Extensive metabolic workup otherwise is negative.  As patient is ambulating, will discontinue fragmin prophylaxis.  Reseen by geriatrics:  Patient does not seem to be delirious anymore She has declined cognitive testing in hospital, but there is clear cognitive impairment secondary to dementia  Sertraline now started at 25 mg, to be increased to 50 mg after 1 week if tolerated to help with paranoia/agitation, which the patient was experiencing at times at home  Primary concern at present is disposition; team is hoping for discharge home with daughter, but some safety mechanisms will need to be in place (home monitoring, kitchen safety, etc.). Will plan to follow patient into next week as team figures at disposition.  Depending on where she is going, patient may be a candidate for our memory clinic as an outpt  Still awaiting records from Sunnybrook, will request again  (I do not see notes from SBK on chart yet.)
